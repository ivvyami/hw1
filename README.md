# hw1 - Excel
For this assignment we managed data through formulas in excel and conditional formating as well asobserved Kickstarter data in multiple different ways by making charts and line graphs, basic statistical analysis, to answer questions on how the data is distributed.

## Getting Started
There is the excel sheet in Github that shows all the work, formulas and all, and there's a word doc link copied on BCS with the charts and answers to the questions on the homeowrk.
